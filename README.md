# Working-with-VPNs
: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.


This task  demonstrates the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to enhance online privacy and security.
A free Proton VPN account was used to connect to a Japan server, verifying IP masking, encryption, and browsing performance changes.
The task highlights how VPNs protect user data, encrypt traffic, and provide anonymous web access.

Steps Performed

Selected VPN Provider

Chose Proton VPN Free, a reputable and privacy-focused VPN with no data limits or ads.

Installation

Downloaded and installed the Proton VPN client on Windows.

Logged in using a free Proton VPN account.

Connection Setup

Connected to the Japan server (Tokyo region) through the Proton VPN dashboard , Screenshots have been uploaded

Verified connection status from the VPN app.

IP Address Verification

Checked IP using whatismyipaddress.com

Observed IP change to a Japanese IP, confirming successful VPN tunneling.

Traffic Encryption Test

Browsed several websites and verified secure HTTPS connections.

Confirmed that browsing data was encrypted and routed through Japan.

Speed & Performance Comparison

Conducted a speed test before and after VPN connection.

Observed a slight reduction in speed and increased latency, which is normal due to encryption and longer routing paths.

Disconnection & Recovery

Disconnected VPN and confirmed IP reverted to original location.

Browsing speed returned to normal.

Research on VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

Proton VPN uses AES-256 encryption, OpenVPN, and WireGuard protocols.

Offers no-logs policy, DNS leak protection, and kill switch features.

Ensures strong privacy even on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.

Benefits of Using VPN

IP Masking: Hides your real IP and replaces it with a VPN serverâ€™s IP.

Data Encryption: Encrypts all network traffic to prevent interception.

Privacy Protection: Shields your browsing activity from ISPs, trackers, and hackers.

Geo-Freedom: Enables access to region-restricted websites and content.

Public Wi-Fi Safety: Secures connections on open networks.

 Limitations Observed

Reduced Speed: Minor drop in download/upload rates due to encryption.

Server Restrictions: Free tier limits available server locations.

Trust Factor: VPN provider still handles your data routing (requires trust in provider).

No Absolute Anonymity: Browser fingerprints, cookies, or logins can still reveal identity.

Some Sites Block VPNs: A few services may restrict access from known VPN IPs.
